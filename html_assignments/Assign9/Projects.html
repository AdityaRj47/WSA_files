    <h4>Self Healing Concrete using chemical admixtures like Meta-K
        and MgO with cost analysis. (06/2023 - 05/2024)
        <br> Research Summary:
        <br>1. Researched the combined effects of crystalline waterproofing
        admixtures, meta-kaolinite, and magnesium oxide (MgO) to enhance
        concrete's self-healing capabilities and extend its service life in harsh
        environments. 
        <br>2. Investigated the individual and synergistic contributions of these
        additives to improve durability and self-repair mechanisms. 
        <br>3. Performed laboratory experiments, including Compression Strength
        Test and Split Tensile Strength Test, to evaluate the self-healing
        efficiency of various concrete mix designs. 
        <br>4. Observed significant recovery after inducing 70% damage, demonstrating the potential for developing durable and sustainable
        concrete formulations.

        <br> Basic Calculator
        <br>Description:
        <br>The focus is on creating a basic calculator. When a user loads the web page, they should see a simple calculator that supports Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, and Division, displaying the results. It's a straightforward calculator without parentheses or any other complex mathematical operations.
        <br>Features:
        <ol>
            <li>A user-friendly calculator interface with buttons for digits (0-9) and basic operators (+, -, *, /).
            <li>The ability to input numbers and perform basic arithmetic operations.</li>
           <li> A display that shows the input and result.</li>
        </ol>

        <br>Basic Image Slider
        <br>Description:
        <br>The goal is to create a basic image slider. When a user loads the web page, they should be able to see a sliding view with a set of preloaded images. The user can scroll through these images using left and right slider buttons.
        <br>Features:
        <ol>
        <li>A sliding view that displays a limited set of preloaded images.</li>
        <li>Left and right slider buttons to navigate through the images.</li>
        </ol>
