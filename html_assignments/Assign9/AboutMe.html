        Hi..Everyone!!
       <br>Aditya here,this side..
    </h2>
    <h4>
      Welcome to my personal blog!!Well, I recognise as Aditya Raj Nayak, age 23 , whos is just graduated in 2024,
      with Bachelor's in Civil engineering but since curiosity has no limits, I now found myself learning more about
      Web Development using HTML,CSS,Javascript.I already have my hands on knowledge and theory about C language,C++, JAVA,
      and Python.Computer languages and various infomatics in software always make me curious, so that's a reason behind taking up different courses,
      and learning them thorroughly.
